    "story": "'Syntactic Structures' by Chomsky, although historically significant, is in actual practise not very useful. In fact, it has hold back progress for a while by insisting that Phrase Structure grammar alone would not be sufficient to deal with natural language. The solution to him, transformational grammar, has proved impossible to use for efficient parsing and Phrase Structure grammar is still very much alive today."

    "story": "Studying EUFID, it dawned on me that there should be a separate model for syntax-to-semantics mapping rules. These are always present, except when a system uses custom procedures. Since we are talking about models, to me a model is a datastructure, or a set of identical datastructures if you will. A model is never just a set of coded functions in the programming language of the system. But I can see that Lisp and Prolog applications have chosen this language exactly because it is easy to create such mapping functions. I would make an exception for such systems if they have developed a formalism that poses a distinct set of restrictions to these functions. So, a LISP function that converts a piece of syntax into a piece of semantics is only a model if its form is highly restricted and its possibilities limited."

    "story": "One might think that it should be possible to create an abstract architecture for NLI that allows independent teams to work on a single module. I am talking about standardization of the interfaces between the modules. I don't think it is possible to do such a thing. There is just not enough overlap between the different systems. For one thing, I don't think that science has settled on the right formalism for the task. While science progresses no team will like to be fixed on any given formalism. Different techniques are suitable for different domains."

    "story": "I still have my doubts about the specialness of EUFID. But the more I read about it, especially the paper \"Semantic database mapping\" by John F. Burger, the more I get impressed. I don't know if EUFID is the first to stress the mapping of the user's view of a domain to the knowledge base representation, but the makers have done a good job at it."

    "story": "I contacted Erik T. Mueller and asked him about the meaning and the origin of the name 'ThoughtTreasure'. It was quite a story and I have placed it on the ThoughtTreasure page.\n\nI also asked him about the main influences of the system. He said they were: 1957 Syntactic Structures by Chomsky; 1984 Cyc commonsense knowledge base started by Douglas Lenat; 1986 The Society of Mind by Marvin Minsky. It is quite interesting because it emphasises that ThoughtTreasure aimed to be a general purpose AI system rather than just a NLI system.\n\nMr. Mueller also gave me some feedback on the ThoughtTreasure features I listed."

    "story": "One thing I learned from ThoughtTreasure is the importance of 'phrase verbs'. The verb 'receive' means something completely different than 'receive from'. Compare: 'The minister received the ambassador.' with 'The minister received a compliment from his secretary.' The first verb means something like 'to meet', the second something like 'to get'. The participles and the prepositions (here: 'from') are part of the verb, and determine its meaning. It is a good idea to store these as separate verbs in the lexicon."

    "story": "Working on ThoughtTreasure.\n\nAfter SHRDLU I thought I had a strong basis with many features and that the other systems would be mainly just a matter of ticking the checkboxes. \n\nI was wrong. In fact, I found it very frustrating to see that ThoughtTreasure has all kinds of features that were not available in SHRDLU. Again, I had to think of new concepts, and change existing divisions of the domain space.\n\nBut when I just started entering the data in the computer I found it to be fun again. It is amazing how these systems differ. And it is intriguing to chart this domain. ThoughtTreasure has explicit higher order cognitive functions (named agents), like emotions and goal recognition. It handles the answering of questions in a more explicit way. I like this idea very much. Mueller groups quite different functions under the term 'agents' so we can't say that all agents are higher order functions. The grouping of functionality itself is interesting."

    "story": "After going through several systems in a somewhat superficial manner, I started do deal with them more thoroughly.\n\nI started with SHRDLU, because it is the first system I consider, and at the same time it has profound coverage of the problem domain. SHRDLU answers questions about it's own internal processes. This is quite remarkable. I would like to show that this is awesome, but at the same time, how it can be done, and that, with the proper data structures, it does not need to be rocket science to pull it off.\n\nI think it is inevitable that my interpretation of the problem domain, the features I discern, and the way the features are grouped by me, is coloured by what I think is important, and by my lack of understanding of the complete field. I hope to reduce my personal influences and I will strive for an objective representation."
