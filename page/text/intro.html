    Hi, my name is Patrick van Bergen.
    <br><br>
    This website is my attempt to answer the following question:
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight">What does it take to make a good Natural Language Interface for Knowledge Bases?</span>
    <br><br>
    To answer this question I examine historic NLI systems.
    <br><br>
    "The NLI system" describes NLI systems in some detail.
    <br><br>
    "Systems chart" allows you to view features per system module, to see which features are more common than others,
    to select all systems that implement a given feature, and to compare the features of two or more systems.
    <br><br>
    "Timeline" is a brief overview of the history of NLI systems.
    <br>
</p>

<h3>What systems are included?</h3>

<p class='story'>
    I just include the systems that make a true effort to allow the user to approach a database with the full range of natural language.
    <br><br>
    Further restrictions I make:
</p>

<ul class='story'>
    <li>Allow users to enter a complex natural language query</li>
    <li>Attempt to find the answer in one or more structured databases (no free text search)</li>
    <li>Use an exact approach to find the answer</li>
    <li>Respond to the question in natural language</li>
    <li>The data and rules are extendible by non-programmers</li>
    <li>It has a public, detailed, description of its workings</li>
</ul>
