<h2>Welcome to the website</h2>

<p class='story'>
    On this website I examine and honour the brave attempts to make true <em>Natural Language Interfaces</em>.
    It is a private website and all views are based on my personal opinion and incomplete knowledge of the subject.
    <br><br>
    For myself this website is a good way to examine NLI systems in a systematic way.
    By using it you may learn more about the structure of NLI systems, and the problems they have to tackle.
</p>

<h3>What systems are included?</h3>

<p class='story'>
    I just include the systems that make a true effort to allow the user to approach a database with the full range of natural language.
    <br><br>
    And further:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Allow users to enter a complex natural language query</li>
    <li>Attempt to find the answer in one or more structured databases (no free text search)</li>
    <li>Use a rule-based, exact, approach to find the answer</li>
    <li>Respond to the question in natural language</li>
    <li>The data and rules are extendible by non-programmers</li>
    <li>It has a public, detailed, description of its workings</li>
</ul>

<p class='story'>
    I might even include a system that fulfills only a single one of these requirements, but it would have to be a historically significant contribution.
</p>

    When I was creating this website I found much inspiration from the the following overview article. I may quote from it from time to time.<br><br>

    Natural Language Interfaces to Databases - An Introduction (1995): I. Androutsopoulos, G.D. Ritchie, P. Thanisch
