    Hi, my name is Patrick van Bergen.
    <br><br>
    This website is my attempt to answer the following question:
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight">What does it take to make a good Natural Language Interface?</span>
    <br><br>
    To answer this question I examine historic NLI systems and extract their features. Each of these systems is special and highlights
    a different aspect of the task.
    <br><br>
    The website allows you to view features per system module, to see which features are more common than others,
    to select all systems that implement a given feature, and to compare the features of two or more systems.
    <br><br>
    Along the way, I try to explain these features as well as I can, and provide examples and links to more information.
    <br><br>
    I hope this will give you a better insight into the nature of NLI systems.
    <br>
</p>

<h3>What systems are included?</h3>

<p class='story'>
    I just include the systems that make a true effort to allow the user to approach a database with the full range of natural language.
    <br><br>
    Further restrictions I make:
</p>

<ul class='story'>
    <li>Allow users to enter a complex natural language query</li>
    <li>Attempt to find the answer in one or more structured databases (no free text search)</li>
    <li>Use a rule-based, exact, approach to find the answer</li>
    <li>Respond to the question in natural language</li>
    <li>The data and rules are extendible by non-programmers</li>
    <li>It has a public, detailed, description of its workings</li>
</ul>

<p class='story'>
    I might even include a system that fulfills only a single one of these requirements, but it would have to be a historically significant contribution.
</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p class='story'>
    I am just a programmer interested in Natural Language. I'm not a scientist. On this website I try to be as scientific as I can,
    but the fact is that many of the features and categories presented on this website were made up by me as I tried to chart the territories of Natural Language Interaction.
    Others may not share my interpretation, and would make other classifications. Take this website as a first draft.
</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>

<p class='story'>
    When I was creating this website I found much inspiration from the the following overview article. I may quote from it from time to time.<br><br>

    <em>Natural Language Interfaces to Databases - An Introduction (1995): I. Androutsopoulos, G.D. Ritchie, P. Thanisch</em>
