[Lee Luda](https://luda.ai/) is a self-learning South Korean chatbot in the form of a 20-year old female student.

It was trained on billions of conversions from KakaoTalk, South Korean's popular messaging app, and when it went online, it learned from user interaction.

Scatter Lab had to take it offline after it started to engage in sexist and discriminatory talk, that was picked up from a small group of its users.

[This FAQ](https://blog.pingpong.us/luda-issue-faq/) explains that Scatter Labs had learned from Microsoft's Tay problems in the past and how it had expected to prevent the problems that occurred. User input was not fed directly into the learning process. Rather it would be labeled as appropriate / inappropriate first. The inappropriate text would even be used to train the system to recognized adversarial attacks.
