The question undergoes a series of translation operations. The first, English -> EFL (English-oriented Formal Language), determines the logical relations between the various parts of the sentence. The second, EFL -> WML (World-Model Language), reformulates the question in terms of the subject domain and checks whether the question makes sense in that domain. The third translation operation, WML -> DBL (Data-Base Language), provides the link between the contents of the question and the chosen data base.
