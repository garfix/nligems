SAM was Roger Schank's main program for understanding stories, based on Conceptual Dependency theory and Scripts Theory. Many of his students worked on it.

SAM creates a causal linked chain of conceptualizations that represent what took place in each story. It uses ELI (English Language Interpreter, by Chris Riesbeck) as a language module.

Example input:

John went to a restaurant. He sat down. Het got mad. He left.

Output paraphrase:

John was hungry. He decided to go to a restaurant. He went to one. He sat down in a chair. A waiter did not goto the table. John became upset. He decided he was going to leave the restaurant. He left it.
