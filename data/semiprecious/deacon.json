  "LONG_DESC": "DEACON uses a list-structured database of military shipments. It does not break neatly into a parsing system, a semantic analyzer and a data processor. The sentence is being processed while it is parsed. For example the rule L1 = M + L : T1(M, L) means that when the combination of word classes M + L is found, substitute for L1 the list which is generated by T1 operating to extract the sublist M from the major list L.",
