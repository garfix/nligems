A successor to Jabberwacky.

from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleverbot :

Unlike some other chatterbots, Cleverbot's responses are not pre-programmed. Instead, it learns from human input: Humans type into the box below the Cleverbot logo and the system finds all keywords or an exact phrase matching the input.

Since launching on the web, the number of conversations held has exceeded 150 million(!)
