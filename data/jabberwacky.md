Jabberwacky is an artificial intelligence - a chat robot, often known as a 'chatbot' or 'chatterbot'. It aims to simulate natural human chat in an interesting, entertaining and humorous manner.
Jabberwacky is different. It learns. In some ways it models the way humans learn language, facts, context and rules.

The whole thing started way back in 1988, and went on the web in 1997. It is unique - not related to any other known AI technologies!

The 'general AI' of Jabberwacky stores everything everyone has ever said, and finds the most appropriate thing to say using contextual pattern matching techniques. In speaking to you it uses just that learnt material, and borrows a little bit of your intelligence as it learns more. With no hard-coded rules, it relies entirely on the principles of feedback. This is very different to the majority of chatbots, which are rule-bound and finite. If you speak in a foreign language it will learn it, and respond appropriately if it has enough to go on. It can be taught slang English, word games, jokes and any other form of identifiable language trait. Everyone contributes, so everyone can enjoy chatting - you could say it's a conversational wikipedia.

Learning purely from conversation gives an AI's general intelligence and character - but is not meant for use in business circumstances where more control over conversational flow is required. For that reason we have a commercial set of Scripting tools that allow for a branching tree of possibilities, plus loops, returns, sentence generation from phrases within phrases, predictions, data extraction and lots more, all handled very unlike any other technology - with fuzzy pattern matching, variety and deep context. Naturally the more freeform "general AI" is combined with this approach to give the best of both worlds.

Icogno Ltd is Jabberwacky's commercially-oriented parent company. The Icogno website contains many pages that will explain further our approach to AI.
