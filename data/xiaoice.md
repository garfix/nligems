Microsoft's [XiaoIce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaoice), an "Empathetic Social Chatbot" is based on an emotional computing framework. 

It has over 660 million registered users.

"Xiaoice has been spreading its influence from China to the whole world. Right now, it has landed on more than 40 platforms in five countries (China, Japan, USA, India and Indonesia) including apps such as WeChat, QQ, Weibo and Meipai in China, and Facebook Messenger in USA and LINE in Japan."

"Over the last 5 years XiaoIce has developed more than 230 skills, ranging from answering questions and recommending movies or restaurants to comforting and storytelling. The most important and sophisticated skill is Core Chat, which can engage long and open-domain conversations with users."

XiaoIce aims to optimize for "_expected_ Conversation-turns Per Session" (CPS). The larger the CPS is, the better engaged the social chatbot is. "Expected" corresponds to long term results.
