"The communication behavior of a system designed for consultation dialogs must be very flexible. Both partners may initiate new subdialogs, e.g., by asking for explanation or additional facts. In order to master this task a system must be able to infer the relevant intentions behind each user utterance. In WISBER those intentions are the basis for determining how the dialog will continue."
