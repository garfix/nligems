Sounding Board is built on top of the Alexa Skills Kit powered by Echo devices, and most of the computation is done in the cloud.

"A hierarchical dialogue manager is employed where a master manages the overall conversation and a collection of miniskills manage different conversation segments. The system constructs responses using speech acts selected by the dialogue manager, where each speech act is instantiated with randomness to introduce variation to the conversation. Further, we analyze the impact of miniskill variety, user personality, and speech recognition performance on user interaction ratings."

The miniskills are content oriented (trending topics, facts, opinions, general news, sports news, jokes, question answering), personality assessment (openness, extraversion) and general (greeting, menu, exit).

+ ! The use of miniskills to implement different aspects of conversation.
