A problem solving program specialized in common sense. PANDORA detects its own goals in an event-driven fashion, dynamically interleaving the creation, execution and revision of its plans.

By itself it does not have natural language interface, but I include this program because it is an important extension to Roger Schank's type of programs.  

Example scenario: 

    PANDORA had just awoken. She had been told that there is a newspaper at the entrance of the driveway. She notices it's raining outside. She knows that she wants to stay dry. So she must come up with a plan to get the newspaper without getting wet. She comes up with the solution to put on a rain coat.
