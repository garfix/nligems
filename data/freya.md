"We present an approach where instead of encoding the specific rules into our NLI system (which would increase the chance of being domain-specific), we use the knowledge encoded in ontologies as the primary source for understanding the userâ€™s question, and only then try to use the output of the syntactic parsing in order to provide the more precise answer."

"Our system is similar to Querix in many aspects, with the main difference that the primary goal of the dialog in our system is not only to resolve ambiguities, but also to map question terms to the relevant ontology concepts."
