NAME-DESC: To rendezvous (i.e. "meet") with the casual user
LONG-DESC: -
Created by the inventor of the relational database, E.F. Codd, this system was designed to meet the quirks of the casual user as much as possible.
The user was allowed to enter one or more sentences, or sentence-parts. He or she was allowed to make changes to the query later.

In contrast to other systems, this system does not parse the user's sentence into a parse tree.
In stead, using conditional rules, patterns of words were interpreted directly as parts of a relational query.
