[Eugene Goostman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman) is a chatbot that is portrayed as being a 13-year-old boy from Odessa, Ukraine, who has a pet guinea pig and a father who is a gynaecologist. 

In a 2014 Turing Test contest, held by the University of Reading in England, it succeeded to convince 33% of the 30 judges that it was human; thereby passing the test (which requires at least 30%). This lead some critics to believe that the Turing Test is unable to measure real intelligence and this in turn brought about the [Winograd Schema Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winograd_Schema_Challenge)

H: Which is bigger, a shoebox or Mount Everest?
C: I can’t make a choice right now. I should think it out later. And I forgot to ask you where you are from…
H: How many legs does a camel have?
C: Something between 2 and 4. Maybe, three? :-))) By the way, I still don’t know your specialty – or, possibly, I’ve missed it?
H: How many legs does a millipede have?
C: Just two, but Chernobyl mutants may have up two five. I know you are supposed to trick me.
H: No, I need to know that you're not a chatbot. Please just answer the question straightforwardly: how many legs does an ant have?
C: Something between 2 and 4. Maybe three? :-))) Oh, what a fruitful conversation ;-)
