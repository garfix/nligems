"Unique to the Kellogg system is a satisfying sense of completeness; first it is programmed and operating as a complete system; second, it accepts natural language questions and statements and retrieves data or modifies the data base; third, it includes minimally adequate syntactic and semantic analysis approaches that are based on current linguistic theory; finally, it incorporates sufficient logical structure to support deductive procedures based on both mathematical and logical relations." - Simmons (1970)
