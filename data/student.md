PhD thesis of Bobrow under supervision of Minsky.

An algebra problem solver which accepts programs phrased in a subset of English and transforms these into equations which can be solved arithmetically.

It can handle problems such as this:

If the number of customers Tom gets is 2 times the square 20 percent of the number of advertisements he runs, and the number of advertisements he runs is 45, what is the number of customers Tom gets?

Analysis is done by replacing words as "twice" by two time, detect words as "plus" and "times" as operators. The rest of the analysis consists of a series of heuristics.
