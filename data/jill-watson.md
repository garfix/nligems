"Jill is an AI-enabled teaching assistant who can answer student questions about a particular class and curriculum."

It is developed by Georgia Institute of Technology and while it is inspired by IBM's Watson, it is not developed by IBM and does not currently use IBM's software. 

"JW1 is essentially a memory of question-answer pairs from previous semesters organized into categories of questions. Given a new question, JW1 classifies the question into a category, retrieves an associated answer, and returns the answer if the classification confidence value is >97%"

Newer versions of JW make use of more advanced techniques.
