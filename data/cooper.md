An elegant example of translation from simple English statements into Aristotelian logic.

Statements are translated into one of the four basic Aristotelian sentence types, "All x is y", "no x is y", "some x is y", and "not all x is y".

The system correctly answers "false" to the assertion "sodium chloride is an element" having already been given the statements, "sodium chloride is salt", "salt is a compound", and "elements are not compounds".
