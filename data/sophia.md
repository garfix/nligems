A robot with a human-like face, facial expressions and speech generation. It gives interviews on TV in many countries and gives the impression of being intelligent.  

It has some primitive pattern matching skills (like ELIZA), but most of its responses are written by a human operator working in the background ([Wizard of Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment))
