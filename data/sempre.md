"SEMPRE is a toolkit for training semantic parsers, which map natural language utterances to denotations (answers) via intermediate logical forms."

It allows you to create rules that map words and phrases to lambda functions and Java structures. This leads to executable Java code. Focuses on NP's and question sentences.

Its main application is access of [Freebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebase_(database)).

Makes use of [Lambda DCS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.4408.pdf) for shorter lamdba expressions.
