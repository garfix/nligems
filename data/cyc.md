CYC is the world's most comprehensive ontology and common sense knowledge base.

It's not an application solving a specific problem, but a platform that is used by many applications.

Its syntactic parser utilizes a phrase-structure grammar loosely based on Government and Binding principles.

Cyc-NL’s semantic component transforms syntactic parses into CycL formulas. The output of the semantic component is "pure" CycL: a parsed sentence can immediately be asserted into the KB, for example, or a parsed question can be presented to the SQL generator in order to pose a database query. Cyc’s semantic interpreter incorporates principles of Montague semantics. Semantic structures are built up piece-by-piece and combined into larger structures. For each syntactic rule, there is a corresponding semantic procedure which applies.
