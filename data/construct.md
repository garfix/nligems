Its major application is in a text-based, question answering system for elementary mathematics.

~~~
H:  Are there any even prime numbers that are greater than 2?

H:  Is the sum of 5 and 2 less than the product of 5 and 2 but greater than the difference of 5 and 2?
~~~

The semantic basis of the system is a collection of procedures for generating and manipulating sets and numbers.
