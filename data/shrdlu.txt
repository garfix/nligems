NAME-DESC: The name SHRDLU was derived from ETAOIN SHRDLU, the arrangement of the alpha keys on a Linotype machine, arranged in descending order of usage frequency in English.
LONG-DESC: -
This is one of the first NLI systems ever created, and at the same time one of the most complete.
It's typical in that it is "procedural" in style. It is designed for a goal-based system called Planner that solves problems by performing procedures. This means that SHRDLU directly transforms each user sentence in a task to be performed by Planner, its knowledge store annex operator agent.
