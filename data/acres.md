PhD thesis of Swagerman, supervised by N.H. Frijda and B.J. Wielenga.

A computer model based on [Nico Frijda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Frijda)'s standard work on emotions [The Emotions](https://www.amazon.com/Emotions-Studies-Emotion-Social-Interaction/dp/0521316006).  

The model has a number of concerns, which the user can influence. When that happens, the model becomes emotional, and acts accordingly.

The user input is limited to a number of commands with arguments, but the response of the system is rich.

   security:    100%
