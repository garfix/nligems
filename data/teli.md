"Since experience has shown that neither users nor svstem designers can predict in advance all the words, phrases, and associated meanings that will arise in accessing a given database. we have sought to make TELI "transportable" in an extreme sense, where customizations may be performed (1) by end users, as opposed to the system designers, and (2) at any time during the processing of English sentences, rather than requiring a complete customization before English processing may occur." 

TELI derives from previous work on the LDC project.
