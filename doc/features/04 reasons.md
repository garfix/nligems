# Reasons for using an NLI

## No knowledge of database representation

While it may still be necessary to teach a user what types of sentences are allowed by the system, and which aren't, the user does not need to know about database implementation details.
Knowledge of domain concepts is enough.

The advantage over SQL is that no database-level knowledge is required; just domain specific knowledge.

## Free-form complex questions

This advantage shares with SQL the power to ask questions at will, not predefined by an application form.

## Speech

NLI sentences may be uttered using speech, which is both natural and efficient for a human, once it masters the sub-language of the NLI.

## Ellipsis

NLI systems that support ellipsis allow the user to phrase a question using just a few words. The rest of the sentence being implicit.

"And German?"
