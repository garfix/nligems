# Syntactic Analysis

Syntactic Analysis is the process of turning a string of raw text into a syntactic structure.

## Tokenization

In all systems, raw text is split into tokens. This means that words, numbers and punctuation characters are distinguished.

## Morphological Analysis

In some systems the morphemes of words are distinguished. This helps keep the dictionary small, since inflections of words need not be stored.

## Sentence structure recognition

Recognizing word combinations is done in two ways:

By parsing a tree structure of the sentence is created.

By template matching a line of input is matched to a template.

Data sources:

* a lexicon
* a grammar
* a set of input-matching templates
