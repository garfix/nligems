# Domain Specific Analysis

This part of pragmatic analysis uses knowledge from the current "domain". It may use domain specific knowledge bases to help it.

## Proper Nouns: Named Entity Recognition (NER)

How to tell proper nouns (names) apart?

A name is only meaningful if it is present, or introduced into, the present domain. This type of NER looks up names in a database.

## Nouns and Adjectives: Compound Noun Analysis

Users may introduce compounds that are not in the lexicon. These come in two shapes:

* noun-noun compounds ("city department")
* adjective-noun compounds ("large company")

The meaning of these compounds is not purely analytical. A "city department" could denote a department located in a city, or a department responsible for a city. A "large company" can be a company with a large volume of sales or a company with many employees.

(example from Androutsopoulos)

## Idioms

Each domain has its own expressions, that are meaningless outside it.
