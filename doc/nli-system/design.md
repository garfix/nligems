# Design

It is not possible to design a system that understands anything a user might ask or say. Everything the system does needs to be hard-coded. The power of the system arises from the combination of hard-coded functions.

An NLI is an interface between a human and a machine. An interface consists of procedures. A procedure has an name/action and a number of arguments.

These are the basic parts of the system for the designer:

1. syntax
2. intents
3. knowledge source interaction

Design starts with step 2. The designer talks to the users of the system and finds out what they want from the system. This results in a number of "intents".

The intents serve as a shield against the user to protect the interaction with the knowledge source.

There are three types of actions: TELL, ASK?, and DO!
