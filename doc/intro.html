    Hi, my name is Patrick van Bergen.
    <br><br>
    This website is my attempt to answer the following question:
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight">What does it take to make a good Natural Language Interface?</span>
    <br><br>
    To answer this question I examine historic NLI systems.
    "The NLI system" describes NLI systems in some detail.
    "Timeline" is a brief overview of the history of NLI systems.
    <br>
</p>

<h3>What systems are included?</h3>

<p class='story'>
    The goal is to collect all systems that have made a contribution to the field of natural language interaction.
    <br><br>
    Further restrictions I make:
</p>

<ul class='story'>
    <li>Allow users to enter a complex natural language query</li>
    <li>Use an exact approach to find the answer</li>
    <li>Respond to the question in natural language</li>
    <li>The data and rules are extendible by non-programmers</li>
    <li>It has a public, detailed, description of its workings</li>
</ul>
