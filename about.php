What systems are included?
Systems that full fulfill a relevant part of the following points of interest:
Allows users to enter a natural language query
Attempts to find the answer in one or more pluggable databases
The data is structured
Responds to the question in natural language
Supports many language constructs (parts-of-speech, clauses, etc.)
Uses a rule-based, exact, approach to find the answer (a statistical approach is a minus)
The extensible parts of the architecture are declarative (rather than procedural)
Uses a database-independent, language independent semantic form as a stage between the parse tree and the database query (i.e. it is not a semantic grammar that directly maps from parse tree to query; the idea is that the mapping from this form to the database form is easier than the mapping from surface form to database form directly)
It has a public, detailed, description of its workings

I might include a system that fulfills only a single one of these requirements, but it would have to be a historically significant contribution.
